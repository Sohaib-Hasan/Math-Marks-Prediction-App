# **Math Marks Prediction App**

### *An End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline with Deployment on HuggingFace Spaces*

---

## **Overview**

This repository contains a complete **Machine Learning project** designed to predict a student’s **Math Score** using demographic attributes and academic performance indicators.
The project demonstrates:

* A clean ML workflow
* Integration of categorical + numerical features
* Model benchmarking & generalization analysis
* A production-ready Streamlit web app
* Deployment on HuggingFace Spaces

This project is ideal for demonstrating **ML engineering**, **feature engineering**, **pipeline design**, and **model deployment** skills.

## **Dataset Description**

The dataset consists of **5 categorical input features**, **2 numerical academic input features**, and **1 numerical target variable**.

### **Categorical Features**

| Feature                       | Description             |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `gender`                      | Student gender          |
| `race/ethnicity`              | Group categories A–E    |
| `parental level of education` | Highest education level |
| `lunch`                       | Standard / Free-reduced |
| `test preparation course`     | Completed / None        |

### **Numerical Features**

| Feature         | Type       | Description                    |
| --------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------ |
| `reading score` | Continuous | Performance in reading (0–100) |
| `writing score` | Continuous | Performance in writing (0–100) |

### **Target Variable**

* `math score` (0–100)

## ⚙️ **Machine Learning Pipeline**

### **1. Preprocessing**

* One-Hot Encoding for categorical features
* Numerical features passed through without scaling
* Implemented using `ColumnTransformer`
* Entire preprocessing integrated in a single `Pipeline`

### **2. Models Trained**

* Linear Regression
* Ridge Regression
* Lasso Regression
* Random Forest Regressor
* Gradient Boosting Regressor

Each model was evaluated using:

* Train R² Score
* Test R² Score
* Cross-Validation Score
* Overfitting/Underfitting analysis

### **3. Final Model**

The best-performing model (balanced bias–variance and highest generalization performance) was serialized as:

```
model.pkl
```

## **Model Evaluation Summary**

| Model             | Train R² | Test R² | Notes                    |
| ----------------- | -------- | ------- | ------------------------ |
| Linear Regression | ~0.874   | ~0.880  | Excellent generalization |
| Ridge             | ~0.874   | ~0.880  | Stable                   |
| Lasso             | ~0.874   | ~0.880  | Stable                   |
| Random Forest     | ~0.977   | ~0.851  | Overfitting              |
| Gradient Boosting | ~0.943   | ~0.871  | Minor overfitting        |

**Conclusion:** Linear / Ridge / Lasso models generalize the best.
